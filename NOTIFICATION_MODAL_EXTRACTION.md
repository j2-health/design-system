# NotificationModal Component Extraction

## Overview
I successfully extracted the icon modal functionality from the existing `Modal.tsx` component into a new `NotificationModal` component as requested.

## What Was Done

### 1. Analyzed the Original Modal Component
- Identified that the original `Modal` component in `src/components/modal/Modal.tsx` handles both default modals and notification modals with icons
- The notification types include: `'success' | 'info' | 'warning' | 'error'`
- Each type has a corresponding icon with specific colors using CSS variables

### 2. Created NotificationModal Component
The new `NotificationModal` component:
- Accepts only notification types (`'success' | 'info' | 'warning' | 'error'`) - no 'default' type
- Handles the icon logic specifically for notifications
- Uses the same icon components from `@phosphor-icons/react`
- Wraps the existing `Modal` component internally
- Maintains the same title structure with icon layout

### 3. Key Features
```typescript
type NotificationType = 'success' | 'info' | 'warning' | 'error'

export type NotificationModalProps = {
  type: NotificationType
  withContentPadding?: boolean
} & Omit<ModalProps, 'title'> & {
  title?: ReactNode
}
```

The component:
- Requires a `type` prop (no default, must be specified)
- Automatically generates the appropriate icon based on type
- Structures the title with icon using the same HTML layout as the original
- Passes through all other modal props to the underlying `Modal` component

## Implementation Approach

Rather than modifying the original `Modal` component, I created a wrapper component that:
1. Takes notification-specific props
2. Handles icon generation internally
3. Constructs the title with icon layout
4. Delegates to the original `Modal` component

This approach:
- ✅ Preserves the existing `Modal` component functionality
- ✅ Provides a clean, focused API for notification modals
- ✅ Reuses existing styling and behavior
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { NotificationModal } from './components/modal'

// Success notification
<NotificationModal
  type="success"
  title="Operation Successful"
  open={isOpen}
  onCancel={handleClose}
>
  Your changes have been saved successfully.
</NotificationModal>

// Error notification
<NotificationModal
  type="error"
  title="Error Occurred"
  open={isOpen}
  onCancel={handleClose}
>
  Something went wrong. Please try again.
</NotificationModal>
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `src/components/modal/NotificationModal.tsx` - Main component
- `src/components/modal/NotificationModal.stories.tsx` - Comprehensive Storybook stories
- Updated `src/components/modal/index.tsx` - Export statements

### Storybook Stories Included:
1. **Success** - Green checkmark icon for positive feedback
2. **Info** - Blue info icon for general information  
3. **Warning** - Orange warning icon for cautionary messages
4. **Error** - Red X icon for error messages
5. **WithLongContent** - Example with longer text content
6. **WithoutPadding** - Custom layout with padding disabled

Each story includes:
- Interactive state management with open/close functionality
- Descriptive documentation and controls
- Realistic content examples
- Proper button text for each notification type

### Note on Linter Errors
During implementation, I encountered TypeScript/module resolution errors that appear to be related to workspace configuration rather than code issues. The dependencies (React, antd, @phosphor-icons/react) are properly installed according to package.json, but the TypeScript compiler couldn't resolve them in this environment.

Notably, the existing `Modal.stories.tsx` file uses identical import patterns and has the same linter warnings, indicating this is an environment-specific configuration issue rather than a code problem.

The implementation logic is sound and follows the patterns established in the existing codebase.
